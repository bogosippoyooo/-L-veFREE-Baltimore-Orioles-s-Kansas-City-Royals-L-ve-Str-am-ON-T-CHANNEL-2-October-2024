How to w𝚊tch the MLB game between the Baltimore Orioles vs Kansas City Royals, as well as the first-pitch time and team news.

The Kansas City Royals and Baltimore Orioles are set to collide in Charm City on Tuesday, as they kick off their postseason run. The first game of their best-of-three AL Wild Card Series at Oriole Park in Camden Yards is scheduled for Tuesday evening.

Kansas City (86-76) battled through a couple of late-season slumps to secure the second AL Wild Card spot. While the Royals' offense is fairly average, their strength lies in a solid combination of pitching and defense. Kansas City's 3.98 runs allowed per game is good enough for sixth-best in MLB.

Meanwhile, Baltimore (91-71) had a mixed stretch over the latter half of the season, finishing just below .500 (34-38) in their last 72 games. However, the Orioles ended September with momentum, sweeping the Minnesota Twins over the weekend and going 5-1 in their last six games. Baltimore holds the top AL Wild Card seed.
